## Trivia-Game - By Alex Raymond

## Why Trivia?

* I chose to create a trivia game because...who doesn't like trivia?!  I felt this would be a challenging project but also a lot of fun in creating the format along with the different categories of my choosing.

## Description
* Welcome to Trivia!  The object of the game is to answer 10 questions correctly without missing more than two.  You have 15 seconds to answer each question before time runs out.  Good luck!

## Getting Started

* Start the trivia game by clicking on the 'Let's Go!' button at the bottom.
* On the following page the player will choose his/her prefered category out of four different options: Sports, Television, Music or Geography.
* Next, the player will choose the difficulty level for the upcoming questions.
* Lastly, the player is brought to a start page and, when ready, will click the 'Start' button to begin.

## Playing the Game

* As the game begins the player is presented with their first question along with four multiple choice answers.
* A 15 second timer will begin and the player will have to choose the answer of their choice before the timer runs out.
* If the timer reaches zero before an answer is chosen, the player will receive one 'Strike' and the question will be replaced.
* If the player correctly answers the question, their 'Score' will go up by one.
* When the player reacehs a 'Score' of 10 - the game is over and the player has won.
* If the 'Strike' count goes above two, the game is over and the player has lost.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery

# Unsolved Problems:

* There are a couple known bugs - When choosing a category, if the player clicks randomly on the screen and not on the buttons they will automatically be brought to the following screen and the game will not display questions.
* Also, not so much a bug other than a lack of questions, if a player misses a question there is a chance they will receive the same question again within the same game.
